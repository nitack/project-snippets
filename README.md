# project-snippets

This respository contains projects that I have worked on in a live environment.  The Schedule-It project was a employee time management applicaiton worked on during my internship.  The Django Message Board was a project for the same internship, so early stage that it didn't even have a name beyond "message board".  The Edgewood Project was a practical application that I took upon myself to build a secondary landing page mockup for my city's website.
