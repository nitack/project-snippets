Before taking on this story the navigation for the applicaiton was not functional.  All pages had to be reached by manually typing in addresses to the address bar, which made working on other stories cumbersome.  The navbar was made functional using HTML, and Django markup to populate our links.  This improved the productivity for all future tickets in the project.

Skills: Django, Python, HTML
