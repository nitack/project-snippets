This project created a partial view to be used on multiple parts of a employee scheduling web application.  Encapsulating this code into a partial allowed us to stick to the Don't Repete Yourself principle of software development.

Files Included:
*FilterPartialview.cshtml - the  code that created the filter in a partial view
*PartialUsedInView.cshtml - A index view that incorporated the partial view using Razor
*ViewOfPartialOnPage.png - The partial view is of the filter loaded into the upper left hand side in the image

Skills:
*C#
*MVC
*Razor
*HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
