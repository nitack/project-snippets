# Schedule-It

This was a project I worked on with a team to develop an employee scheduling web application.  The project utilized C#, 
MVC and Entity Framework, with a frontend rooted in bootstrap.  The database was established using a code first model.  
My work on this project ranged from small style tweaks on the front end, to significant coding to filter and retrieve 
data from the back end.  In addition to working on specific coding tasks already established, I also identified 
opportunities to improve the backend structure, and add additional functionality to the project.
